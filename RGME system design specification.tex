\section*{Abstract}
Running Gear Monitoring Equipment (RGME) is a device used to Monitoring Running Gear's condition in real time. This device is equipped with multiple built-in microphones, which can accurately collect the acoustic signals information inside the train carriage. Through in-depth analysis of these acoustic signals, the acoustic fingerprint features of the running gear's rotating components (such as bearings and wheel treads) transmitted through the carriage can be successfully extracted.

By using advanced filtering algorithm,it can precisely strip the acoustic fingerprint features of the rotating components from the complex noise environment inside the carriage. By conducting a detailed and comprehensive analysis of these acoustic fingerprint features,real-time monitoring of the health status of bearings and wheel treads can be achieved.
Compared with the traditional axle temperature monitoring technology solutions,this solution has significant advantages. It can initiate real time tracking of the health status of bearings and wheel treads as soon as early anomalies occur. By continuously and real-timely monitoring the health of the monitored targets over a long period, false alarms and misalarms can be effectively avoided, and strong support can be provided for predictive maintenance.

This document focuses on introducing the design specifications of the RGME system, covering aspects such as system architecture, component specifications, electrical schematic diagrams, mechanical design and installation, relevant safety design, and Man - Machine Interface (MMI) design.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background Introduction}
Urban rail transit has many advantages such as large transportation capacity, high efficiency, low energy consumption, intensiveness, convenience for riding, safety and comfort, etc. It is an important way to solve the problem of urban traffic congestion, realize the adjustment of urban spatial layout and the balanced development of the city. Compared with high-speed railways, the train axle weight of urban rail transit is lighter and the operation speed is lower. 

However, due to the influence of factors such as many small-radius curves, a large number of vibration-damping ballast beds, relatively low track smoothness standards, small train intervals, and frequent starting and stopping of trains, the interaction between the wheels and the rails is extremely intense, leading to frequent occurrence of faults such as wheel tread damage, abnormal bearing wear, and the rotating mechanism of the train running gear. 

According to statistics, the faults of the running gear of urban rail trains in China (including axle box, gear box and traction motor bearing faults, transmission gear faults, and wheel tread damage) account for about 40 percent of the train faults. The wide application of vibration-damping ballast beds has made rail corrugation occur frequently, which has become an important challenge faced by urban rail transit operation departments and researchers. The resulting vibration and noise not only affect the physical and mental health and riding comfort of passengers, but also pose a major challenge to the safety of train operation and the normal operation of equipment.
\subsection{Drawbacks of Traditional Solution}
At present, in response to the faults of the train running gear, most urban rail trains in China are equipped with axle temperature detection devices. However, this method can only detect the axle temperature, and the parameter is single. Moreover, a significant temperature rise phenomenon will only occur when the bearing fault deteriorates to a certain extent, and early warning cannot be achieved. 

Some developed cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have developed real-time monitoring systems for the running gear. These systems install composite sensors at the key parts of the bogie (such as the axle box, motor, gear box, etc.), and use relevant processors and diagnostic equipment to process and analyze multi-physical quantity signals such as vibration, impact, and temperature collected in real time. This significantly improves the real-time performance, accuracy, and stability of the fault detection of the running gear, and realizes the early warning of faults. 

However, the installation of this system is relatively complex. It is necessary to make physical modifications to the detected components, and it involves a large number of cable connections, which increases the maintenance difficulty for operation and maintenance personnel. In addition, its high cost also limits its widespread promotion. 
\subsection{Advantage of Acoustic Solution}
Acoustic fingerprint recognition initially refers to the extraction and analysis of features from human acoustic signals to distinguish different speakers. Nowadays, researchers and engineers use acoustic fingerprint recognition technology to study the status of the detected objects and apply acoustic processing algorithms to the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of equipment. When typical faults such as train bearing faults, wheel tread damage, and rail corrugation occur, obvious mechanical vibrations and noises with distinct characteristics will be generated. 

In order to detect these faults in advance and determine their early-stage status, a specially designed on-board acoustic sensor array terminal can be installed on the vehicle body or inside the carriages to collect the acoustic signals generated by these faults. Combined with appropriate algorithms and acoustic fingerprint recognition technology, accurate identification of these faults can be achieved. Compared with traditional detection methods such as vibration and temperature detection, acoustic fingerprint recognition has the advantage of non-contact measurement. There is no need to make physical modifications to the detected components, and it will not affect the mechanical strength of the original structure. Moreover, it has a low cost, simple installation, and convenient maintenance.

By providing reliable operation data support, this technology can help the operation and maintenance department detect and eliminate faults in the early stages of faults, avoid the expansion and extension of typical faults, and is of great significance for ensuring the safety of train operation, improving riding comfort, reducing the workload of maintenance, and lowering operation and maintenance costs.

\section{Working Principle}
\subsection{Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Principle}
Rolling bearings are one of the key components of the running part of the train. Good operation of the bearings is the premise to ensure the safe operation of the train. In order to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the train, it is essential to regularly check and maintain the bearings.
The causes of rolling bearing failure are complex and diverse. Factors such as heavy loads, complex loads, excessive speed or acceleration, and extreme temperatures may all cause early failure. In addition, improper mechanical assembly and neglect of operating norms will also exacerbate this problem. The following is a brief analysis of the main types of failure of rolling bearings and their causes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wear: mainly caused by foreign body intrusion and insufficient lubrication. Wear usually occurs on the contact surface of the bearing inner ring, outer ring and rolling element, resulting in increased bearing clearance, decreased working accuracy and shortened service life, accompanied by increased vibration and noise.
    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./滚体擦伤.png}
        \caption{Bearing Scratch}
        \label{fig:bear-scratch}
    \end{figure}
    \item Fatigue spalling: Rolling bearings are subjected to alternating loads for a long time, and cracks will occur between the rolling elements and the inner and outer rings, usually in the area of maximum shear force. As the bearing runs for more time, the cracks gradually expand, eventually leading to contact surface spalling, which in turn increases the impact load and the degree of failure.
    \item Corrosion: The corrosion of rolling bearings mainly includes three types: chemical corrosion, electrical corrosion and micro-vibration corrosion. Chemical corrosion is caused by corrosive liquids, and electrical corrosion is caused by electric sparks generated by electric currents. The micro-vibration corrosion mainly occurs on the ferrule and is caused by small relative movements.
    \item Plastic deformation: Dents or scratches on the surface of the rolling element and raceway due to overload, impact, improper installation or intrusion of hard objects. These defects can increase the impact load between the rolling element and the inner and outer rings, thereby aggravating the failure and causing plastic deformation of the bearing.
    \item Fracture: When subjected to overload, the components of the rolling bearing may break, which in turn affects its normal operation. In addition, if there is a problem in the grinding, heat treatment or assembly process, the residual stress inside the component will increase, which will cause fracture.
    \item Glue: When two metal surfaces adhere to each other, it is called gluing. The main reason is that the excess heat generated by the rolling bearing cannot be dissipated in time, which is usually related to insufficient lubrication, high-speed movement or excessive load. Glue failures mostly occur between the cage and the rolling elements.
    \item Cage damage: Improper assembly or overload can increase the friction between the cage and the rolling elements, causing the cage to deform, further causing friction to heat up, causing more failures, and even causing the rolling elements to get stuck, while increasing vibration and noise.
\end{enumerate}

In the process of train running, the complex track environment, wheel-rail contact and other external excitation factors interact with the internal structural characteristics of the bearing, machining and assembly errors and potential failures, causing the vibration of the bearing.

During train operation, bearings are affected by uneven external forces. This imbalance of external forces, as well as changes in the number of rolling elements, can lead to periodic fluctuations in bearing carrying capacity, which can lead to vibration and noise. In addition, manufacturing errors or inconsistencies in the dimensions of bearing rolling elements can also lead to changes in support stiffness, which can be a potential factor in vibration generation. Irregularities in bearing surfaces, such as corrugations or bumps, can also cause random vibration.

During assembly, if the degree of fastening is not strictly controlled, too loose may cause the bearing to move in the axial direction, and too tight may cause local component deformation or changes in clearance, which can lead to periodic vibration. In addition, improper lubrication conditions can significantly affect the friction characteristics of bearings, which can lead to vibration and noise. During the operation of the bearing, any shock load may excite its natural vibration frequency, especially the natural frequency of the outer ring is relatively low, so it is most susceptible to excitation. When analyzing the frequency spectrum of vibration or acoustic signals, the natural frequency of the outer ring is usually particularly significant. 

When there is a local defect in the bearing part, the collision between the rolling element and the inner and outer rings will produce an impact signal. This impact signal is significantly different from the vibration characteristics under normal working conditions, and the duration is extremely short. The impact frequency of each part is also different. This frequency is called the interval frequency of the local defect, which can reflect most of the fault conditions, so it is called the failure frequency of the bearing. In order to solve the problem of the failure frequency of the bearing, the following derivation can be made.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./轴承结构简图.png}
    \caption{Bearing Structure Diagram}
    \label{fig:Bearing-structure}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Bearing-structure}, let the diameter of the bearing rolling element be d, the diameter of the bearing inner ring is $D_i$ , the diameter of the bearing outer ring is $D_o$, the corresponding bearing middle diameter is D, the angular velocity of the outer ring is $\omega _o$, the angular velocity of the inner ring is $\omega_i$, and the contact angle between the rolling element and the inner ring raceway is $\alpha $. According to the geometric relationship, the relationship between the diameter of the inner and outer rings of the bearing and the diameter of the rolling element can be deduced, as shown in the following formula:

\begin{equation}
    D_i = D - d \cos\alpha
    \label{eq:2.1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    D_o = D + d \cos\alpha
    \label{eq:2.2}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    v_i = \frac{1}{2} \cdot w_i \cdot D_i
    \label{eq:2.3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    v_o = \frac{1}{2} \cdot w_o \cdot D_o
    \label{eq:2.4}
\end{equation}

The linear speed of inside and outside scrolling is shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.3} and \ref{eq:2.4}.

Assuming that the rolling element rolls purely in the raceway, and the rotational speed of the cage is the average of the rotational speed of the inner ring and the outer ring, the rotational linear speed of the cage is as shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.5}.

\begin{equation}
    v_c = \frac{1}{4} [\omega_b (D - d \cos a) + \omega_\omega (D + d \cos a)]
    \label{eq:2.5}
\end{equation}

According to the formula \ref{eq:2.5}, the angular velocity of the cage can be obtained as shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.6}.

\begin{equation}
    w_c = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \omega_b \left( 1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right) + \omega_\omega \left( 1 + \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right) \right]
    \label{eq:2.6}
\end{equation}

Since $\omega = 2 \pi f$, the rotation frequency of the cage is as shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.6}.

\begin{equation}
    f_c = \frac{1}{2} \left[ f_i \left( 1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right) + f_o \left( 1 + \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right) \right]
    \label{eq:2.7}
\end{equation}

If the outer ring is fixed, then $f_o = 0$, so the formula \ref{eq:2.7} can be reduced to the formula \ref{eq:2.8}.

\begin{equation}
    f_c = \frac{1}{2} f_i \left( 1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)
    \label{eq:2.8}
\end{equation}

Formula \ref{eq:2.8} is also the rotation frequency of the cage relative to the outer ring. The rotation frequency of the cage relative to the inner ring is shown in Formula \ref{eq:2.9}.

\begin{equation}
    f_\alpha = f_i - f_c = \frac{1}{2} f_i \left( 1 + \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)
    \label{eq:2.9}
\end{equation}

The rotation frequency of the roller is shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.10}.

\begin{equation}
    f_{bt} = f_{ci} \frac{D_i}{d} = \frac{1}{2} f_i \frac{D}{d} \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)^2 \right]
    \label{eq:2.10}
\end{equation}

The rotation of the cage relative to the inner ring causes the rolling elements to pass n times at the same contact point of the inner ring, where n represents the total number of rolling elements. The failure frequency of the bearing can be deduced by multiplying the relative rotation frequency of the component by the number of times it has passed. In the case of the inner ring rotating and the outer ring stationary, the rotation frequency of the bearing is the same as the rotation frequency of the inner ring. According to formula \ref{eq:2.11}, the failure frequency of the outer ring of the rolling bearing can be calculated:

\begin{equation}
    f_o = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{60} \cdot n \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)
    \label{eq:2.11}
\end{equation}

The calculation of the failure frequency of the inner ring of the rolling bearing is shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.12}.

\begin{equation}
    f_i = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{60} \cdot n \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)
    \label{eq:2.12}
\end{equation}

The calculation of the failure frequency of rolling bearings and rolling elements is shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.13}.

\begin{equation}
    f_b = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{60} \cdot \frac{D}{d} \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{d}{D} \right)^2 \cdot \cos^2 a \right)
    \label{eq:2.13}    
\end{equation}

The failure frequency calculation of the friction between the rolling bearing cage and the outer ring is shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.14}.

\begin{equation}
    f_{co} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{60} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)
    \label{eq:2.14}
\end{equation}

The failure frequency calculation of the friction between the rolling bearing cage and the inner ring is shown in the formula \ref{eq:2.15}.
\begin{equation}
    f_{ci} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{r}{60} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{d}{D} \cos a \right)
    \label{eq:2.15}
\end{equation}

In the formulas \ref{eq:2.11} to \ref{eq:2.15}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_o$ is the failure frequency of the outer ring of the rolling bearing (Hz);
    \item $f_i$ is the failure frequency of the inner ring of the rolling bearing (Hz);
    \item $f_b$ is the failure frequency of the rolling element of the rolling bearing (Hz);
    \item $f_{co}$ and $f_{ci}$ is the failure frequency of the friction between the rolling bearing cage and the outer ring (Hz);
    \item $r$ is the rotational speed of the rolling bearing (r/min);
    \item $n$ is the number of rolling elements of the bearing;
    \item $d$ is the diameter of the rolling element of the bearing (mm);
    \item $D$ is the diameter of the rolling bearing pitch circle (mm);
    \item $\alpha$ is the contact angle of the rolling element.
\end{itemize}

In order to solve the interference of non-stationary signal frequency conversion on fault frequency under variable speed conditions, ENSONIC research team use the fault characteristic order ratio to characterize the fault frequency characteristics. Compared with the traditional fault frequency calculation formula, the calculation method of the fault characteristic order ratio is simpler, and there is no need to introduce the independent variable of frequency conversion. For the specific calculation formula, please refer to the table \ref{tab:order-ratio}.

\subsection{Wheel Tread Fault Diagnosis Principle}

As an important driving part of a vehicle, the health of wheels is directly related to the safety and efficiency of operation. Due to the operational characteristics such as fast start, frequent braking and start-stop, and poor track line status, the wheel tread of trains is at risk of various failures. The common forms of train wheel tread damage are local wheel damage such as flat scar and peeling, and full-circumferential wheel damage such as pit wear and wheel polygon. In addition to this, it also includes defects such as trauma, delamination, collapse, etc. The impact of these damages on the dynamic response of wheels and rails is similar to that of local wheel damage.

Tread failure not only exacerbates the wear and tear of the moving parts of the vehicle, but also induces vibration and noise problems, which affect the comfort of passengers. In some cases, wheel tread failure may also cause excessive local loads, resulting in unstable operation and increased safety risks. In addition, uneven tread wear can also affect the dynamic characteristics of the wheelset, increasing the dynamic wheel weight and accelerating the wear of the track structure.

Wheel thread out of roundness involves a variety of factors, such as the irregular initial shape of the wheel and the vibration excitation of the wheel and rail during long-term operation. The out of roundness can be divided into two types: partial out of roundness and full-circumference out of roundness. The partial out of roundness refers to the appearance of some radial defects on the wheel tread, such as scratches or peeling. The full-circumference out of roundness is mainly manifested as the wheel polygon, that is, the wheel radius changes periodically on the entire circumference.

When the train is running, the contact between the normal wheel tread and the rail will generate low-frequency and relatively stable noise; conversely, when the irregular wheel passes through the rail, it will cause abnormal impact vibration noise with different periodicity. Therefore, by analyzing the characteristics of the noise acoustic signal, potential causes of wheel roundness can be identified.

Scratches and peeling are common tread failures.Figure \ref{fig:wheel-rolling} is a schematic diagram of the faulty wheel running.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Wheel rolling.png}
    \caption{Wheel Rolling Schematic Diagram} 
    \label{fig:wheel-rolling}
\end{figure}

At low speed, when the wheel rolls to the starting point A of the abrasion, it rotates with point A as the center of the circle and the length L of the abrasion as the radius until the entire abrasion surface touches the track. When all the abrasion surfaces hit the rail, the wheel will continue to rotate at the center of the abrasion termination point B, thus applying additional power to the track until the wheel returns to normal rotation.

At high speed, the wheel will detach from the rail surface after reaching point A, rotate in the air and move forward inertia, and finally contact the track at point B, resulting in a certain amplitude of impact. When the time required for the wheel to move from state A to state B is equal to the time required for the wheel center to fall, the speed reaches the critical state of wheel-rail impact.

During driving, if only a single fault exists, the impact frequency of the track will be equal to the rotation frequency of the wheel, $f = V_c / 2 \pi R$ ( $f$ is the impact frequency, $V_c$ is the running speed, $R$ is the wheel radius). When the running speed is $V_c$ less than the critical speed, the impact time $t_r$ between the tread and the rail, the vertical impact speed is $v_0$.

\begin{equation}
    t_r = \frac{L}{v_c} \approx \frac{2 \sqrt{2 R d}}{v_c}
    \label{eq:2.21}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    v_0 = v_c \sin \frac{\phi}{2} \approx v_c \frac{1}{2} \frac{L}{R} \approx v_c \frac{\sqrt{2 R d}}{R}
    \label{eq:2.22}
\end{equation}

The impact mechanical kinetic energy generated during the impact process is.

\begin{equation}
    E_M = \frac{1}{2} M v_0^2 = M v_c^2 \frac{d}{R}
    \label{eq:2.23}
\end{equation}

Where $M$ is the mass of the wheel, $d$ is the depth of the abrasion.

When the running speed $V_c$ is greater than the critical speed, the impact time $t_r$ and vertical impact speed $v_0$ between the tread and the rail are:

\begin{equation}
    t_r = \frac{L}{v_c + \sqrt{\mu R}} \approx \frac{2 \sqrt{2 R d}}{v_c + \sqrt{\mu R}}
    \label{eq:2.24}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    v_0 = \frac{\mu L}{v_c + \sqrt{\mu R}} \approx \frac{2 \mu \sqrt{2 R d}}{v_c + \sqrt{\mu R}}
    \label{eq:2.25}    
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mu = \frac{M_1 + M_2}{M_2} g
    \label{eq:2.26}    
\end{equation}

Where $M_1$ is the sprung mass, $M_2$ is the unsprung mass, and $g$ is the acceleration of gravity.

The impact mechanical kinetic energy generated during the impact process is:
\begin{equation}
    E_M = \frac{1}{2} M v_0^2 = 4 M \frac{\mu^2 R d}{(v_c + \sqrt{\mu R})^2}
    \label{eq:2.27}    
\end{equation}

According to the above analysis, tread failure will cause periodic vibration and shock between the wheel and the track. As the running speed increases, the impact effect between the wheel and the track will also increase. At the critical speed, the impact effect reaches its maximum value, after which it will gradually weaken and eventually stabilize.

The wheel polygon is a manifestation of the irregular shape of the wheel, which can be mathematically modeled by summing the harmonic waves of different orders. Theory and practice show that the order of the wheel polygon is usually between 1 and 20. In most cases, the wheel polygon is dominated by one of the orders.

When the train is running, if there is a wheel polygon, there will be a periodic dynamic force between the wheels and rails, resulting in shock and vibration of the wheel-rail system, which will significantly affect the stability and durability of the vehicle and other components of the rail system.

The first-order wheel polygon, that is, the eccentricity of the wheel, is a typical harmonic excitation. Due to the action of centrifugal excitation, the wheel-rail system will produce periodic forced vibration, and the cycle of the wheel-rail force change is roughly equivalent to the time it takes for the wheel to complete a week.

The second-order wheel polygon shows the elliptical shape of the wheel, and the period of wheel-rail force change is about half of the time of wheel rolling. By analogy, the existence of wheel polygon will affect the vibration and radiation noise of the vehicle during operation, which will lead to the generation of periodic pulse and impact frequency. Impact frequency $f = n V_c / 2 \pi R$ ($n$ is the order of wheel polygon).

\subsection{Calculation Report of Installation}

\subsubsection{Each Module with Mounting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Screw Specifications: Use M6 × 7 cross countersunk screws. M6 means the nominal diameter of the screw is 6mm.
    \item Material characteristics: Scew's material is 304 stainless steel, with a yield strength of 200-300MPa and a median value of 250MPa. Assuming the mounting is made of aluminum alloy, the friction coefficient $\mu$  between the stainless steel screw and the aluminum alloy is about 0.35 (experience value)
    \item Preload calculation: According to the preload formula $F_{max} =\frac {\pi} {4}\times d ^ {2}\times\frac {\sigma_ {s}} {n})$ (the safety factor n is 1.5), substitute the data to get$F_ {max} =\frac {\pi} {4}\times 6 ^ {2}\times\frac {250} {1.5}\approx 11781N$.
    \item Torque calculation: Torque formula$T = K \times F\times d$, the torque coefficient K is related to the surface state of the screw and the lubrication situation. When there is no lubrication, it is usually between 0.18 and 0.22. Take$K = 0.2$ here. Substitute$F_ {max}$ and K and d into,$T = 0.2 \times 11781\times 0.006\approx 14.1N · m$. Considering the convenience and safety of actual installation, it is recommended that the actual torque value be 9 - 11N · m.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Each Module with Structure Beam}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Screw Specifications: Use M5 × 8 304 stainless steel POM nylon tip bolts. M5 means the nominal diameter of the screw is 5mm.
    \item Material Characteristics: 304 stainless steel screws are connected to the steel structure beam, and the friction coefficient is about 0.3 (experience value).
    \item Calculation Idea: The yield strength of 304 stainless steel is generally between 200 - 300MPa, and the safety factor is 1.5. The maximum allowable preload force$F_ {max} =\frac {\pi} {4}\times d ^ {2}\times\frac {\sigma_ {s}} {n}$. For M5 screws,$F_ {max} =\frac {\pi} {4}\times 5 ^ {2}\times\frac {250} {1.5}\approx 6545N$. Torque coefficient K is 0.3.
    \item Torque Calculation: Substitute the torque formula $T = K\times F\times d$,$T = 0.3\times 6545\times 0.005\approx 9.8N · m$. In practical applications, the recommended value is 6-8N · m, which can not only ensure the firmness of the connection, but also prevent damage to screws or structural beams due to excessive torque.
